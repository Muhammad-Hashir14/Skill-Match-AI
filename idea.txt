💼 Intelligent Resume Screener & Job Match App
🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend/UI: Django templates (or optionally React/Streamlit frontend)

Backend: Django (Python)

Vector DB: FAISS (for local, fast similarity search)

LLM: Gemini via LangChain (for NLP tasks, analysis, generation)

Others: PyPDF2 / docx2txt (to extract text from files), pandas (for metadata), SQLite/Postgres (user/job data)

📁 Key Features
1. Resume & Job Description Upload
Users (HR or candidates) can upload:

Resume (PDF/DOCX)

Job Description (text or PDF)

Backend extracts clean text from both.

2. Skill & Keyword Extraction
Use Gemini to extract key:

Skills

Tools/technologies

Roles/responsibilities

Store this in structured format (e.g., JSON, tags).

3. Semantic Matching using FAISS
Convert both resume and job description into vector embeddings (via Gemini embeddings or LangChain-compatible ones).

Store in FAISS index.

Run similarity search to compute match score (e.g., cosine similarity).

Show top matching resumes (if HR) or job matches (if candidate).

4. LLM-Powered Insights
Show:

Match Score (%)

Top missing skills

Summary of why it’s a good/bad fit

Optional: Generate a tailored cover letter using Gemini with a prompt like:

"Write a short cover letter for a candidate with the following resume applying to the following job..."

5. Admin/HR Panel
View uploaded resumes

Filter by match %, skills

Export shortlist (CSV/PDF)

🧠 Sample Workflow
User Uploads Resume + JD

text_extraction.py cleans and extracts text

embedding.py converts both to vectors via Gemini

matcher.py stores vectors in FAISS and computes similarity

cover_letter_gen.py uses Gemini + prompt template to generate a custom letter
